I've been learning Rust for a few months now, and I've been using the [Rust the Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) as
my main resource. I've been meaning to write a review of it for a while now, but I've been putting it off because I've
been busy with other things. I've finally got around to writing it now, so here it is.

**TODO**
